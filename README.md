- Hi, I’m @HelenaWilliams
- I’m interested in ... just about anything CS related! I've worked in robotics, web design, and artificial intelligence in the past few years.
- I’m currently learning ... about computer graphics, French, sociology, and calculus.
- I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing much right now, but in the future, I'll hopefully find time to do cool things with other GitHub users.
- How to reach me ... You can find me on Handshake and LinkedIn!
